1.Installing Docker on Ubuntu
Installing Docker from the Official Repository (Option 1)

Install Docker from the official Docker repository to ensure you get the latest stable program version. To access the official Docker repository, add the new package source to Ubuntu and then install Docker. Follow the steps below:
Step 1: Update the Package Repository
Run the following command to update the system's package repository and ensure the latest prerequisite packages are installed:

# sudo apt update -y

When prompted, enter your root password and press Enter to proceed with the update.

Step 2: Install Prerequisite Packages
The apt package manager requires a few prerequisite packages on the system to use packages over HTTPS. Run the following command to allow Ubuntu to access the Docker repositories over HTTPS:

# sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y

The command above:

Allows apt to transfer files and data over https.
Allows the system to check security certificates.
Installs curl, a data-transfer utility.
Adds scripts for software management.

Step 3: Add GPG Key
A GPG key verifies the authenticity of a software package. Add the Docker repository GPG key to your system by running:

# curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Adding the Docker GPG key to verify package authenticity.
The output should state OK, verifying the authenticity.

Step 4: Add Docker Repository
Run the following command to add the Docker repository to apt sources:

# sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

The command adds the official Docker repository and updates the package database with the latest Docker packages.

Step 5: Specify Installation Source
Execute the apt-cache command to ensure the Docker installation source is the Docker repository, not the Ubuntu repository. The apt-cache command queries the package cache of the apt package manager for the Docker packages we have previously added.

Run the following command:

# sudo apt-cache policy docker-ce

Step 6: Install Docker
Install Docker by running:

# sudo apt install docker-ce -y

Wait for the installation process to complete.

Step 7: Check Docker Status
Check if Docker is installed, the daemon started, and the process is enabled to start on boot. Run the following command:

# sudo systemctl status docker

The output states that the Docker daemon is up and running.

Installing Docker from the Default Repositories (Option 2)

Another way to install Docker on Ubuntu is to use the default Ubuntu repository. Although the installation process is more straightforward, the Docker package may be outdated. If you don't care about having the latest Docker version, follow the steps below and install Docker using the default repository.

Step 1: Update the Repository
Ensure that the local system package repository is updated by running:

# sudo apt update

Enter the root password when prompted and wait for the process to finish.

Step 2: Install Docker
Run the following command to install Docker:

# sudo apt install docker.io -y

Specifying the -y flag automatically answers yes to any prompt during the installation.

Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install all the Docker dependency packages by running the following command:

# sudo snap install docker

The command installs all the dependencies using the Snap package manager.
Step 4: Check Installation
Check whether Docker was properly installed by running the status command or checking the program version. To see the Docker daemon status, run:

# sudo systemctl status docker

Alternatively, check the program version by running:

# docker --version

Checking Docker program version.
